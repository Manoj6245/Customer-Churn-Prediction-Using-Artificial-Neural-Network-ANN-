Created a Machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a Telecom company’s services.
Techniques Used:
• Data Imbalance Handling: Utilized the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
method to address data imbalance issues. This approach ensures that the model is trained on
balanced data, leading to more accurate predictions.
• Predictive Model: Implemented Different Classifying algorithms and choosen ANN, to enhance
prediction accuracy and to better metrics.
